SCIDv2.0.0: (System for Control of Inventory)

This application is on Yii2 Framework and a lotâ€™s of Krajee goodies.

Is designe for small business for control the orders and shippins of
the products on sale.

I use krajee's goodies for the GridView, the datepicker, and more.

With a new architecture and security feauters.

The backend:
It was made for the manager of the business, in here you can control everything:

* Units of measure us on packing
* Freights
* Products
* Users
* Parameters

The frontend:
It was made only for the costumer, in here you only can order the products and see the state of the shippments.

I use a FIFO to consume the inventory.

For taxes and units it's on construction.
